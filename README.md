## What’s Shake Shock?

Shake Shock it’s a Play-and-Earn (PaE), the first of its kind. Like many games in Crypto, the mechanics are highly dependable on the design of the games, the incentives of trade, and how fun it is.

Shake Shock starts with the creation of Adam and Eve, mere humans that initially were alone in the world and through different decisions evolve and move into different continents, clans, and ultimately civilizations.

Civilizations are born, rise and fall. Intimately tied with human nature, groups of people need to communicate and decide the fate of civilizations and their characters. In the meantime, a battle for the world will be fought, earning different civilizations more wealth and power.
